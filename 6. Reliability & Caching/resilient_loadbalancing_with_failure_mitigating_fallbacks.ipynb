        "# Setting up resilient Load balancers with failure-mitigating Fallbacks\n",
        "\n",
        "Companies often face challenges of scaling their services efficiently as the traffic to their applications grow - when you’re consuming APIs, the first point of failure is that if you hit the API too much, you can get rate limited. Loadbalancing is a proven way to scale usage horizontally without overburdening any one provider and thus staying within rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "For your AI app, rate limits are even more stringent, and if you start hitting the providers’ rate limits, there’s nothing you can do except wait to cool down and try again. With Portkey, we help you solve this very easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cookbook will teach you how to utilize Portkey to distribute traffic across multiple LLMs, ensuring that your loadbalancer is robust by setting up backups for requests. Additionally, you will learn how to load balance across OpenAI and Anthropic, leveraging the powerful Claude-3 models recently developed by Anthropic, with Azure serving as the fallback layer.\n",
